## üîÑ Next Steps When You Return

### **PRIORITY 1: Begin Phase 8 - Email System**

Start with SendGrid integration for transactional emails:

1. Set up SendGrid account and API keys
2. Create email service in `/src/services/email.ts`
3. Implement email templates:
   - Welcome email
   - Purchase confirmation
   - Credit expiration warnings
   - Subscription notifications
4. Add email triggers to relevant endpoints

### **PRIORITY 2: Complete Phase 7 - Admin Logging**

Update all admin endpoints to include proper audit logging:

- User management actions
- Credit adjustments
- System configuration changes
- All admin activities should be logged

### **PRIORITY 3: Consider Phase 6 - ChatGPT Integration**

If prioritizing AI features over email:

1. Research current ChatGPT image generation API
2. Implement generation service
3. Create UI for prompt building
4. Add to processing pipeline
