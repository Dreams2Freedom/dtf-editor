# ✅ Storage Cleanup System - Implementation Complete

## Summary

The automatic storage cleanup system is now fully operational. Free user images will be automatically deleted after 48 hours to manage storage costs.

## What's Active

### 1. Database Infrastructure

- ✅ `expires_at` column added to `processed_images` table
- ✅ Automatic expiration calculation on image upload
- ✅ Triggers update expiration when user plans change
- ✅ Cleanup function removes expired images

### 2. Expiration Rules

- **Free Users**: Images expire 48 hours after upload
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Images expire 90 days after last credit purchase
- **Subscribers**: Images never expire (permanent storage)

### 3. Automatic Cleanup

- **Job ID**: 1
- **Schedule**: Every hour at minute 0 (1:00, 2:00, 3:00, etc.)
- **Status**: Active ✅
- **Command**: `SELECT cleanup_expired_images()`

### 4. UI Updates

- Gallery shows expiration warnings
- "Expires in X hours" for urgent cases
- "Expired" label for past-due images
- Red text color for all warnings

## Monitoring the System

### Check Recent Cleanup Runs

```sql
SELECT
  runid,
  status,
  return_message,
  start_time,
  end_time
FROM cron.job_run_details
WHERE jobid = 1
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### View Current Image Status

```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN expires_at IS NULL THEN 'Permanent'
    WHEN expires_at < NOW() THEN 'Expired (awaiting cleanup)'
    WHEN expires_at < NOW() + INTERVAL '24 hours' THEN 'Expiring Soon'
    ELSE 'Active'
  END as status,
  COUNT(*) as image_count
FROM processed_images
GROUP BY status;
```

### Manual Cleanup (if needed)

```sql
SELECT cleanup_expired_images();
```

## User Experience

### For Free Users

- Clear 48-hour expiration warning on all images
- Countdown timer when less than 24 hours remain
- Encouragement to upgrade for permanent storage

### For Paying Users

- No expiration dates shown
- Peace of mind with permanent storage
- Seamless experience

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Email Notifications**: Send warning emails before images expire
2. **Grace Period**: Add 24-hour grace period before deletion
3. **Recovery Option**: Allow recovery of deleted images for 7 days
4. **Storage Analytics**: Dashboard showing storage usage trends

## Troubleshooting

### If images aren't being cleaned up:

1. Check if cron job is active: `SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobid = 1;`
2. View job errors: `SELECT * FROM cron.job_run_details WHERE jobid = 1 AND status != 'succeeded';`
3. Run manual cleanup: `SELECT cleanup_expired_images();`

### To temporarily disable cleanup:

```sql
SELECT cron.unschedule(1);
-- or
SELECT cron.unschedule('cleanup-expired-images');
```

### To re-enable:

```sql
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'cleanup-expired-images',
  '0 * * * *',
  $$SELECT cleanup_expired_images()$$
);
```
