# Image Gallery Integration Changes

**Date**: January 30, 2025
**Author**: Claude
**Reason**: Adding "My Images" gallery feature to user dashboard

## Overview

This document tracks the changes made to integrate the image processing system with the new "My Images" gallery feature. These changes modify how processed images are stored and tracked.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Database Changes (ALREADY COMPLETED)

- Added `processed_images` table to store image metadata
- Added `last_credit_purchase_at` column to profiles table
- Created functions for calculating image expiration dates

### 2. UI Changes (ALREADY COMPLETED)

- Added ImageGallery component at `/src/components/image/ImageGallery.tsx`
- Added "My Images" section to dashboard at `/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

### 3. Image Processing Changes (IMPLEMENTED - January 30, 2025)

The following changes were made to `/src/services/imageProcessing.ts`:

- Updated `saveProcessingResult()` method to save to `processed_images` table
- Added automatic expiration date calculation using database function
- Updated `getProcessingHistory()` to read from `processed_images` table
- Added `getApiProviderForOperation()` helper method
- Added `mapOperationTypeToOperation()` for data consistency

**Backup created at:** `/src/services/imageProcessing.ts.backup`

## Changes to Image Processing Flow

### BEFORE (Current State)

1. User uploads image
2. Image is processed by external API
3. Processed image is returned directly to user
4. No record is kept of the processed image

### AFTER (Proposed State)

1. User uploads image
2. Image is processed by external API
3. Processed image is saved to Supabase Storage
4. Image metadata is saved to `processed_images` table
5. Storage URL is returned to user
6. Images appear in user's gallery

## Potential Breaking Points

1. **Storage Failures**: If Supabase Storage is down or full, image processing could fail
2. **Database Writes**: If database writes fail, users might lose track of processed images
3. **Performance**: Additional storage and database operations could slow down processing
4. **Cost**: Storing images will increase storage costs
5. **Existing Workflows**: Any code expecting direct image data might break if we return URLs instead

## How to Revert

If the changes cause issues, here's how to revert:

### 1. Revert Image Processing Endpoints

```bash
# Use git to revert the specific files
git checkout HEAD -- src/app/api/process/upscale/route.ts
git checkout HEAD -- src/app/api/process/background-removal/route.ts
git checkout HEAD -- src/app/api/process/vectorize/route.ts
```

### 2. Keep Database Changes

The database changes are backward compatible and don't need to be reverted. The tables will simply remain empty.

### 3. Hide Gallery UI (Optional)

If needed, comment out the ImageGallery section in the dashboard:

```tsx
{
  /* My Images Gallery - Temporarily disabled */
}
{
  /* <div id="my-images" className="mt-8">
  <ImageGallery />
</div> */
}
```

## Testing Checklist

Before considering the integration complete, test:

- [ ] Upscale operation still works
- [ ] Background removal still works
- [ ] Vectorize operation still works
- [ ] Images appear in gallery after processing
- [ ] Download from gallery works
- [ ] Delete from gallery works
- [ ] Storage policy (48hr/90day/permanent) is correctly applied
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Error handling when storage fails

## Implementation Notes

When implementing the changes:

1. Add try-catch blocks around storage operations
2. Make storage/database saves non-blocking if possible
3. Always return the processed image even if storage fails
4. Log storage failures but don't break the user experience
5. Consider adding a feature flag to enable/disable gallery integration

## Rollback SQL (If Needed)

```sql
-- To remove the processed_images table (CAUTION: This deletes all stored image records)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS processed_images CASCADE;

-- To remove the last_credit_purchase_at column
ALTER TABLE profiles DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS last_credit_purchase_at;

-- To remove the trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_last_credit_purchase_trigger ON credit_transactions;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_last_credit_purchase();
```

**Remember**: The goal is to enhance the user experience without breaking existing functionality. If in doubt, implement changes gradually with feature flags.
