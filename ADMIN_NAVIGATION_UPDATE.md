# Admin Navigation Update - Super Admin Access

## Changes Made

Added a "Super Admin" navigation item to the admin dashboard sidebar that:

- Only appears for users with `super_admin` role
- Links to `/admin/users/admins` (Admin User Management)
- Uses a ShieldCheck icon to distinguish it from regular admin features

## Files Modified

### `src/components/admin/layout/AdminSidebar.tsx`

**Changes:**

1. Added `ShieldCheck` icon import from lucide-react
2. Added `createClientSupabaseClient` import for checking user role
3. Added state management for super admin status:
   - `isSuperAdmin` - boolean state
   - `isLoading` - loading state
4. Added `useEffect` hook to check if user is super admin on component mount
5. Updated `hasPermission()` function to check for `super_admin` permission
6. Added "Super Admin" menu item to `menuItems` array:
   ```typescript
   {
     name: 'Super Admin',
     href: '/admin/users/admins',
     icon: ShieldCheck,
     permission: ['super_admin'],
   }
   ```

## How It Works

1. When the sidebar component mounts, it calls `get_admin_role()` RPC function
2. If the user's role is `super_admin`, the "Super Admin" menu item appears
3. Clicking it navigates to `/admin/users/admins` where super admins can:
   - View all admin users
   - Create new admin users
   - Edit admin permissions
   - Manage admin roles

## User Experience

**For Super Admins (Shannon@S2Transfers.com):**

- ✅ See "Super Admin" menu item in sidebar
- ✅ Can click to access admin user management
- ✅ No need to manually type URL

**For Regular Admins:**

- ❌ Do not see "Super Admin" menu item
- ❌ Cannot access admin user management (even with direct URL, they're blocked by middleware)

## Testing

To test the changes:

1. Log in as Shannon@S2Transfers.com
2. Navigate to any admin page (e.g., `/admin`)
3. Check the sidebar - you should see "Super Admin" menu item with a shield icon
4. Click it to navigate to `/admin/users/admins`

## Database Requirements

This feature requires the following database functions to exist:

- ✅ `get_admin_role(user_id UUID)` - Returns user's admin role
- ✅ `is_super_admin(user_id UUID)` - Checks if user is super admin

Both functions were created in the previous fix.

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:

1. Add badge showing number of admin users
2. Add "Manage Admins" submenu under Users section
3. Cache the super admin check to avoid repeated RPC calls
4. Add visual separator before Super Admin section in sidebar
