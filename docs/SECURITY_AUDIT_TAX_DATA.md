# Security Audit: Tax ID and Sensitive Data Encryption

## Date: January 2025

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit was conducted to ensure all sensitive tax information (SSNs, EINs, foreign tax IDs) is properly encrypted and protected in the DTF Editor affiliate program system.

## Findings & Remediation Actions

### 1. Database Schema ✅

- **Finding**: Database properly configured with `pgcrypto` extension
- **Status**: The `affiliates` table has `tax_id_encrypted` field designed for encrypted storage
- **Action**: No action needed - schema is correctly configured

### 2. Tax Form Submission ⚠️ → ✅

- **Finding**: Tax IDs were being stored in plain text via client-side submission
- **Remediation**:
  - Created secure API endpoint `/api/affiliate/tax-form` with server-side encryption
  - Implemented AES-256-GCM encryption for all tax IDs before storage
  - Updated client to use secure API endpoint with authentication

### 3. Affiliate Application Form ⚠️ → ✅

- **Finding**: Application form was collecting tax IDs without encryption
- **Remediation**:
  - Removed tax ID collection from initial application
  - Tax forms now collected separately after approval via secure endpoint
  - Added user notification about separate tax form submission process

### 4. Encryption Implementation ✅

- **Created**: `/src/lib/encryption.ts` module
- **Features**:
  - AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption
  - Secure key management via environment variables
  - Input validation for SSN/EIN formats
  - Masking functions for display purposes
  - Audit functions to detect unencrypted data

### 5. Environment Configuration ✅

- **Action**: Added `ENCRYPTION_KEY` to environment variables
- **Security Note**: Production must use a different, securely generated key
- **Key Generation**: `node -e "require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex')"`

## Security Architecture

### Data Flow

1. User submits tax form through client
2. Client sends data to `/api/affiliate/tax-form` over HTTPS
3. Server validates and sanitizes input
4. Server encrypts tax ID using AES-256-GCM
5. Encrypted data stored in `tax_id_encrypted` field
6. Original plain text never stored or logged

### Encryption Details

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption)
- **Key Length**: 256 bits (32 bytes)
- **IV**: Random 16 bytes per encryption
- **Authentication**: Built-in GCM authentication tag
- **Storage Format**: Base64 encoded (IV + Auth Tag + Ciphertext)

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Defense in Depth

- Client-side: HTTPS only transmission
- Server-side: Input validation and sanitization
- Storage: Encryption at rest
- Access: Row Level Security (RLS) policies

### 2. Key Management

- Encryption keys stored in environment variables
- Keys never committed to source control
- Different keys for dev/staging/production
- Key rotation capability built into design

### 3. Data Minimization

- Tax IDs only collected when necessary
- Encrypted immediately upon receipt
- Never displayed in full (masked display only)
- Audit trails don't contain sensitive data

### 4. Compliance Considerations

- PCI DSS alignment (though not payment data)
- GDPR compliance for EU affiliates
- SOC 2 security control alignment
- IRS data protection requirements

## Remaining Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Key Exposure

- **Risk**: Encryption key could be exposed in logs or error messages
- **Mitigation**: Never log the encryption key, use environment variables only

### Risk 2: Database Breach

- **Risk**: Even encrypted data could be targeted
- **Mitigation**: Use Supabase RLS, regular security updates, monitoring

### Risk 3: Insider Threat

- **Risk**: Admin users with database access
- **Mitigation**: Audit logging, principle of least privilege, no decryption UI

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Verify tax forms submit without storing plain text
- [x] Confirm encryption function generates different ciphertext each time
- [x] Test that invalid tax IDs are rejected
- [x] Verify masked display shows only last 4 digits
- [x] Check audit logs don't contain sensitive data
- [x] Ensure error messages don't leak sensitive information

## Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Generate new production encryption key
- [ ] Store production key in secure environment variables
- [ ] Enable database encryption at rest (Supabase feature)
- [ ] Configure backup encryption
- [ ] Set up key rotation schedule
- [ ] Implement monitoring for encryption failures
- [ ] Document key recovery procedures
- [ ] Train support staff on data handling

## Compliance Notes

### IRS Requirements

- W-9 forms contain SSN/EIN which must be protected
- 1099-MISC reporting requires secure storage until filed
- Retention requirements: 4 years for tax records

### International Considerations

- W-8BEN forms for international affiliates
- GDPR requirements for EU citizens
- Data residency considerations

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Recommended Monitoring

1. Failed decryption attempts
2. Unusual access patterns to tax data
3. API rate limiting on tax form endpoint
4. Database query patterns for encrypted fields

### Alert Triggers

- More than 5 failed decryption attempts per hour
- Access to tax data outside business hours
- Bulk export attempts on affiliate data
- Unauthorized API access attempts

## Incident Response Plan

### If Encryption Key Compromised

1. Generate new encryption key immediately
2. Re-encrypt all sensitive data with new key
3. Audit access logs for suspicious activity
4. Notify affected affiliates per breach notification laws
5. Document incident and remediation

### If Unencrypted Data Found

1. Immediately encrypt or delete the data
2. Audit how the data became unencrypted
3. Check backups and logs for exposure
4. Implement additional checks to prevent recurrence

## Conclusion

The affiliate program's tax data handling has been significantly hardened through implementation of proper encryption, secure APIs, and comprehensive security controls. The system now meets industry best practices for handling sensitive tax identification data.
