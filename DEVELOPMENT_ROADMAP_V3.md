## 📋 **Implementation Guidelines**

### **🚨 CRITICAL: Use Context7 MCP for Latest Documentation**
Before implementing ANY feature in Phases 4-8:
1. **Search Context7 for current API docs** (Stripe, Supabase, etc.)
2. **Don't rely on outdated examples** - APIs change frequently
3. **Priority searches:**
   - "Stripe subscription API 2025"
   - "Supabase Edge Functions cron jobs"
   - "Stripe webhook verification Next.js"
   - "Supabase RLS policies examples"
4. **Update API_CODE_EXAMPLES.md** with verified working code

### **Testing Strategy**
- Test each feature in isolation before integration
- Always test payment flows in Stripe test mode
- Verify credit calculations are accurate
- Test free/paid user experiences separately

### **Database Migrations**
- Create migrations for each schema change
- Test migrations on staging first
- Always have rollback plans
- Document migration steps

### **Feature Flags**
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Test features with internal users first
- Monitor for errors before full release
- Have kill switches for new features

### **Monitoring**
- Add logging for all payment events
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Track feature adoption
- Set up alerts for failures
