## üéØ Bottom Line

**Can you launch with current documents?** Yes, but risky  
**Should you make updates first?** Yes, especially refund policy  
**Time to implement critical fixes:** 30-60 minutes  
**Legal review recommended?** Yes, but not blocking for soft launch

The documents are well-structured and cover most bases. The main concerns are:

1. Overly restrictive refund policy (biggest risk)
2. Missing cookie disclosure (compliance issue)
3. Too broad promotional rights (trust issue)

Make the critical fixes above and you'll be in good shape for launch!
