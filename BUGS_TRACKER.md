### **BUG-053: Welcome Email Not Sent During Signup**
- **Status:** 🟢 FIXED
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Component:** Email System / Signup Flow
- **Description:** Welcome emails not being sent when new users sign up
- **Symptoms:**
  - Test emails from Mailgun worked correctly
  - User received test emails immediately
  - But no email received during actual signup process
- **Root Cause:**
  - Environment variable mismatch: signup route was using `env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` instead of `env.SUPABASE_URL`
  - This caused a "supabaseUrl is required" error that prevented the signup API from executing
- **Solution Applied:**
  - Fixed environment variable reference in `/src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`
  - Changed from `env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` to `env.SUPABASE_URL`
  - Emails now being sent successfully via Mailgun
- **Verification:**
  - Server logs confirm: "Email sent successfully: <20250819020612.719a59b0ddbb8d12@mg.dtfeditor.com>"
  - Mailgun API returning success responses
- **Note:** If emails still not received, likely going to spam or blocked by recipient provider. User should check Mailgun dashboard for bounces and verify domain DNS configuration (SPF, DKIM).

  - "Invalid login credentials" error preventing access
  - Dashboard showed "Failed to load images" with 403 errors
  - Images saved with 0 bytes and broken links
  - Vectorized images never saved to gallery (0 records in DB)
  - Deep-Image temporary URLs expiring before save
- **Root Causes Found:**
  1. **Authentication**: Missing redirect URLs in Supabase, missing getAuthState() method
  2. **403 Errors**: Duplicate RLS policies for both {public} and {authenticated} roles
  3. **Image Storage**: Deep-Image URLs expire quickly, needed immediate download
  4. **Signed URLs**: Storing signed URLs that expire instead of storage paths
  5. **Vectorization**: Database constraint only allowed 'upscale' and 'background-removal', not 'vectorization'
- **Solution Applied:**
  1. Fixed authentication by adding redirect URLs and implementing getAuthState()
  2. Cleaned duplicate RLS policies, kept only {authenticated} role policies
  3. Modified Deep-Image service to download images immediately and convert to data URLs
  4. Changed storage approach to save paths and generate signed URLs on demand
  5. Updated database constraint to include 'vectorization' as valid operation_type
- **Technical Details:**
  - Deep-Image returns temporary URLs at `/api/downloadTemporary/` that expire quickly
  - Implemented immediate download and base64 conversion in deepImage.ts
  - Storage bucket remains private with signed URL generation (1-hour expiry)

  - Users had 2 credits, tried to add 2 more, still showed 2 credits
  - Success toast appeared but credits didn't update
- **Root Cause:** 
  - API was trying to call non-existent `add_credits_bulk` RPC function
  - Fallback code was working but only after initial RPC failure
  - Database column is `credits_remaining`, not `credits`
- **Solution Applied:**
  - Removed RPC call attempt since function doesn't exist

- **Symptoms:**
  - Background removal worked but images didn't show in gallery
  - Gallery showed "No processed images yet" despite processing
  - Broken image links when images did appear
- **Root Causes Found:**
  1. Database permission issue - service role couldn't access `processed_images` table
  2. ClippingMagic has different flow - doesn't use standard image processing service
  3. Wrong storage bucket - used private bucket with public URLs
- **Investigation Process:**
  - Found RLS policies blocking service role access
  - Tried multiple RLS fixes, even disabled RLS entirely
  - Issue persisted - problem was at PostgreSQL role level, not RLS
  - Created wrapper RPC functions as workaround
- **Solution Applied:**
  1. Created RPC wrapper functions with SECURITY DEFINER:
     - `insert_processed_image` - For saving images
     - `get_user_images` - For fetching images
     - `delete_processed_image` - For deleting images
  2. Updated `/api/clippingmagic/download/[id]` to save images to gallery
  3. Switched from private `user-images` to public `images` bucket

  - Error: "You're importing a component that needs 'next/headers'"
  - CostTrackingService importing server-side Supabase client
- **Root Cause:** 
  - CostTrackingService was importing createServerSupabaseClient
  - This service is used in client components (CostAnalyticsDashboard)
  - Server-side imports can't be used in client components
- **Solution Applied:**
  - Changed CostTrackingService to use client-side Supabase client
  - Imported createClient directly from @supabase/supabase-js
  - Used env variables for client-side initialization

### **BUG-032: Admin Login Cookie Not Persisting**
- **Status:** 🟢 FIXED
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Component:** Admin Authentication
- **Description:** Admin login succeeds but cookie not set/read properly, causing redirect loop
- **Symptoms:**
  - Login form submits successfully
  - Success toast appears
  - Redirect to /admin occurs
  - Middleware redirects back to /admin/login (cookie not found)
  - Session stored in localStorage but not accessible to middleware
- **Root Causes Identified:** 
  1. Dual authentication systems (regular Supabase auth + custom admin auth)
  2. HttpOnly cookie can't be read by JavaScript (mismatch in design)
  3. Middleware checks cookie, client checks localStorage
  4. Possible Next.js 15 cookie handling issues in development
- **Investigation Process:**
  - Found temporary security bypasses left in admin middleware from previous debugging
  - Discovered over-engineered custom admin auth system with separate tables, 2FA support, IP whitelisting
  - Identified fundamental architecture mismatch: middleware needed cookies, client used localStorage
  - HttpOnly cookies couldn't be accessed by JavaScript causing sync issues
- **Solution Applied:**
  - **Step 1:** Removed all security bypasses and console.log statements
  - **Step 2:** Scrapped entire custom admin auth system (admin_users, admin_roles tables)
  - **Step 3:** Simplified to use Supabase auth + is_admin flag in profiles table
  - **Step 4:** Updated admin middleware to check Supabase session instead of custom cookies
  - **Step 5:** Modified all admin components to use regular authStore
  - **Step 6:** Added proper initialization in admin login page
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Changed `adminAuthService` references to `authStore` throughout
  - Updated middleware to use `supabase.auth.getUser()` instead of custom cookie checks
  - Modified AdminLayout, AdminHeader, AdminSidebar to use standard auth
  - Fixed initialization timing issues with proper await/async handling
- **Benefits:**
  - Simpler architecture (one auth system instead of two)
  - No cookie/localStorage conflicts
  - Works with Supabase's built-in session management
  - Less code to maintain (removed ~500 lines of custom auth code)
  - Follows YAGNI principle - avoided over-engineering
- **User Confirmation:** "the admin dashboard is now showing"
- **Date Fixed:** July 30, 2025

  5. Cookie setting/reading issue in development environment - FIXED
- **Solution Applied:**
  - Updated cookie setting to use cookies() function directly
  - Added credentials: 'include' to fetch requests
  - Implemented localStorage/sessionStorage fallback
  - Simplified redirect logic with query param
  - Added session verification on admin dashboard
  - Disabled React strict mode to reduce hydration errors
  - Admin dashboard now checks localStorage for session
- **Verification:**
  - Admin can login successfully

  - Plan upgrades/downgrades don't sync
  - Credits not allocated automatically
  - Dashboard shows old plan/credit info
  - Manual database sync required for all operations

  - Main webhook at `/api/webhooks/stripe` had correct handlers but wasn't receiving events
- **Solution Applied:**

### **BUG-012: ClippingMagic White Label Editor Implementation**
- **Status:** 🟡 IN PROGRESS
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Component:** ClippingMagic Integration
- **Description:** Initial implementation incorrectly assumed iframe embedding, but editor opens in popup
- **Root Cause:** 
  - Misunderstood API documentation - ClippingMagic.edit() opens a popup window, not iframe
  - Internal iframe created by ClippingMagic.js is for internal use only
  - The `X-Frame-Options: sameorigin` error is from internal implementation, not the actual editor
- **Investigation:**
  - Initially thought editor was embedded as iframe
  - Discovered ClippingMagic.js creates internal iframe for communication
  - API docs clearly state editor opens in popup window
  - Browser popup blockers may prevent editor from opening
- **Solution Being Implemented:** 
  - Upload image to ClippingMagic first to get ID and secret
  - Use ClippingMagic.edit() to open editor in popup window
  - Handle callback events for result/error/exit
  - Warn users about popup blockers
