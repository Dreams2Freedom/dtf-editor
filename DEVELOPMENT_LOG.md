## 🗓️ June 7, 2026 — Email Outage Diagnosed & Hardened (BUG-063)

**Problem:** No emails sending at all (welcome, signup admin alerts, receipts).

**Diagnosis (deep dive):** The email code (Mailgun via `src/services/email.ts`) was
fully implemented and the signup route correctly `await`s sends — not a serverless
async bug. Using the Vercel MCP, production runtime logs showed
`EmailService: Mailgun not configured` on `/api/auth/signup`, proving
**`MAILGUN_API_KEY`/`MAILGUN_DOMAIN` are missing/empty in Vercel Production**. The
outage was invisible because every send method `return true`'d when unconfigured.

**Fixes (code):**

- Replaced all silent `return true` guards with a `notSent()` helper that logs
  `NOT SENT [type]` and returns `false`.
- Added `MAILGUN_REGION` (us/eu) support — the API URL was hardcoded to US
  (`api.mailgun.net`), which 401s for EU domains. Applied in `email.ts` and the
  `auth-email-handler` edge function.
- `validateEnv()` now warns when Mailgun config is missing.
- New diagnostic endpoint `GET/POST /api/admin/email-health`.

**Remaining (owner action):** Restore the Mailgun env vars in Vercel Production and
redeploy, then verify via `/api/admin/email-health`. Note: no Supabase Edge
Functions are deployed, so auth emails (reset/confirm/magic-link) rely on Supabase
SMTP. Also noted a pre-existing undefined `getEmailFooter()` call (follow-up).

   - Admin Dashboard Implementation (Phase 5-7)
   - Gallery & Storage Features
   - Navigation System Overhaul
   - Privacy Policy & Terms of Service
   - Phase 4 Completion (Credit System & Payment Features)

3. **[DEVELOPMENT_LOG_PART3.md](./DEVELOPMENT_LOG_PART3.md)** - January 2025 & Earlier Entries

## 🔍 IMPORTANT: Session Reading Instructions

**⚠️ For Claude Code at the beginning of each session:**

When reading the Development Log at the start of a new session:

1. Read through all three parts (DEVELOPMENT_LOG_PART1.md, PART2.md, PART3.md)
2. **Extract and retain in memory only the critical information needed to continue the project:**
   - Current development phase and status
   - Recent bugs and their fixes
   - Active features being worked on
   - Key architectural decisions
   - Important technical patterns
   - Unresolved issues
3. **Do NOT store the entire content** - only retain what's necessary for the current work
4. **Leave the full documents intact** - they serve as the complete historical record

This approach ensures you have the context needed while managing token usage efficiently.
