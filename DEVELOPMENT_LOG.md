## 🔍 IMPORTANT: Session Reading Instructions

**⚠️ For Claude Code at the beginning of each session:**

When reading the Development Log at the start of a new session:

1. Read through all three parts (DEVELOPMENT_LOG_PART1.md, PART2.md, PART3.md)
2. **Extract and retain in memory only the critical information needed to continue the project:**
   - Current development phase and status
   - Recent bugs and their fixes
   - Active features being worked on
   - Key architectural decisions
   - Important technical patterns
   - Unresolved issues
3. **Do NOT store the entire content** - only retain what's necessary for the current work
4. **Leave the full documents intact** - they serve as the complete historical record

This approach ensures you have the context needed while managing token usage efficiently.
