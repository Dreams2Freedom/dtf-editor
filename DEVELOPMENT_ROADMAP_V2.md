## üö® **Critical Success Factors**

### **Do NOT proceed to next phase until:**
1. Current phase is fully tested
2. No critical bugs remain
3. Features work end-to-end
4. Code is properly documented

### **Key Principles:**
1. **Foundation First** - No advanced features on shaky ground
2. **Test Everything** - Each feature must work before moving on
3. **User Focus** - Core features before nice-to-haves
4. **Incremental Progress** - Small, stable releases
