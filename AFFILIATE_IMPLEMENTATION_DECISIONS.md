## üî¥ **Tax & Legal Infrastructure**

- PDF generation for record keeping

### **1099 Generation**

**Solution:** ADP integration for tax reporting

**Status:** ‚úÖ Already configured for mass payouts

### **Check Processing**

**Solution:** Internal handling

---

## üí≥ **Payment Processing**

### **PayPal API**

**Action:** Obtain API credentials for PayPal Payouts API

- Use sandbox for testing

### **Payout Schedule**

**Decision:** Manual monthly payouts

- Run on 1st of each month
- Process all affiliates above $50 threshold
- Admin initiates payout batch
- Email notifications upon completion

### **International Payments**

- 30-day grace period for repayment
- Legal action for balances > $100
- Add strong language to affiliate agreement

---

## üîí **Security Implementation**

### **SSN/Tax ID Storage**

**Solution:** Supabase Vault encryption

```sql
-- Use Supabase Vault for encryption
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;

-- Encrypt sensitive fields
UPDATE affiliates
SET tax_id = pgp_sym_encrypt(tax_id, current_setting('app.encryption_key'))
WHERE tax_id IS NOT NULL;
```

### **PCI Compliance**

**Solution:** No payment data stored locally

- PayPal handles all payment information
- We only store PayPal email addresses
- No credit card data in our database

### **Fraud Detection Rules**

1. **Self-referral blocking:**
   - Check email match on signup
   - Check IP address match
   - Block same payment method
2. **Rate limiting:**
   - Max 100 clicks/day per affiliate
   - Max 20 signups/day per affiliate
   - Alert on unusual patterns

---

## üìä **Analytics & Reporting**

### **Phase 1 (MVP):** Basic reporting only

- Click counts
- Conversion counts
- Commission totals

### **Phase 2 (Future):**

- Google Analytics integration
- UTM parameter tracking
- Advanced conversion analytics
- PDF report generation

---

## üö¶ **Launch Strategy**

### **Beta Launch Plan**

1. **Week 1-2:** Internal testing with 5 test affiliates
2. **Week 3-4:** Beta with 10-20 selected affiliates
3. **Week 5:** Full launch to all users

### **Existing Users**

- Grandfather into refer-a-friend program only
- Must apply for full affiliate program

### **Rollback Plan**

```bash
# Database backup before launch
pg_dump > backup_before_affiliate_launch.sql

# Feature flag for quick disable
ENABLE_AFFILIATE_PROGRAM=false
```

---

## üìß **Email Communications**

### **Email Templates Required**

1. **Application Received**
   - Subject: "Affiliate Application Received"
   - Confirm receipt, set expectations

2. **Approval Email**
   - Subject: "Welcome to DTF Editor Affiliate Program!"
   - Getting started guide, referral link

3. **Rejection Email**
   - Subject: "Affiliate Application Update"
   - Polite rejection, reapplication info

4. **New Conversion**

## üéØ **Business Rules**

### **Referral Rules**

- **Self-purchase:** ‚ùå Blocked (IP and email checking)
- **Coupon stacking:** ‚úÖ Allowed (max 50% off first month)
- **Retroactive attribution:** ‚úÖ User can assign affiliate post-signup
- **Email changes:** ‚úÖ Attribution follows user ID, not email
- **Downgrades:** Commissions adjust proportionally

### **Auto-Approval Logic**

**Auto-approve if ALL conditions met:**

- Valid website/social media provided
- No suspicious patterns detected
- Tax form completed
- Not flagged country/region

**Flag for manual review if:**

- No website/social presence
- Suspicious email domain
- High-risk country
- Previous fraud history

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Clarifications**

### **Credit System Compatibility**

**No Conflict:** Affiliate credits are separate from user credits

- Affiliate earns commission in dollars
- Can use commission for credit purchases
- Credits given as prizes don't affect user credits

### **Stripe Webhook Modifications**

**Required Changes:**

```javascript
// In stripe webhook handler
case 'payment_intent.succeeded':
  // Existing payment processing
  await processPayment(event);

  // NEW: Trigger commission calculation
  await calculateAffiliateCommission(event);
  break;

case 'charge.refunded':
  // NEW: Reverse affiliate commission
  await reverseAffiliateCommission(event);
  break;
```

### **Database Backup Strategy**

```bash
# Daily automated backups
0 2 * * * pg_dump production > /backups/daily/$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).sql

# Before major changes
pg_dump production > /backups/pre-affiliate-launch.sql
```

### **Infrastructure Capacity**

**Current limits are sufficient for MVP:**

- Supabase: 500M rows (plenty for tracking)
- API calls: 1M/month (sufficient for MVP)
- Storage: 100GB (minimal affiliate data)
